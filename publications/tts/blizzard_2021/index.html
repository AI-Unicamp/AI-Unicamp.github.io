        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Abstract:</b> This paper presents the CPQD-UNICAMP text-to-speech sys-tem  for  Blizzard  Challenge  2021.
          The  system  consists  ofa  bilingual  linguistic  front-end,  an  acoustic  model  based  onTacotron2  and  a  Parallel  Wavegan  neural  vocoder.  
          A  multi-speaker Brazilian Portuguese dataset was added to the Blizzard2021  dataset  in  order  to  train  a  bilingual  acoustic  model  andthe neural vocoder.   
          Such modules were later fine-tuned withthe target speaker data.  Sentences were classified according tothe punctuation type and a specialized model was trained foreach  
          category  to  better  model  the  intonation  pattern  of  non-declarative  sentences.   The  Blizzard  Challenge  evaluation  forthe hub task show that the proposed 
          strategy achieved high nat-uralness, intelligibility and similarity results.
